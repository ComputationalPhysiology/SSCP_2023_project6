# SSCP_2023_project6
This repository contains an implementation of the contraction model from Land et al (2017).
The formulation of the calcium transient is taken from Rice et al (2008), which can 
be parameterized to look similar to the Ca transient shown in Fig. 6 of Land et al (2017).
The land2017.ode file contains the model specification in Gotran ode format. The 
folder python contains the python model code generated from the .ode-file, as
well as a couple of demo scripts to test the model.
